# Predictive Maintenance with Deep Anomaly Detection

This work is course project of the standalone masters course Machine learning for Predictive Maintenance 

## Project Description
Implementation of deep learning models for anomaly detection in industrial equipment using the Aramis Challenge dataset. Developed Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder (β-VAE), and GANomaly architectures to identify component degradation.

## Key Features
- Three distinct deep learning approaches for anomaly detection
- Specialized β-VAE variants addressing latent collapse
- Adaptation of GANomaly (image-based) to tabular sensor data
- Comprehensive evaluation with ROC/PRC 

## Models Implemented
1. **Autoencoder** - Baseline reconstruction-based anomaly detection
2. **β-VAE** - Two variants focusing on reconstruction vs KL divergence
3. **GANomaly** - Adversarial approach with latent space comparison

## Future Work
- Incorporation of temporal features
- Hyperparameter optimization
